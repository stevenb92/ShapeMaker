{"name":"Shapemaker","tagline":"Simple Java Swing Program used to draw Rectangles and Oval","body":"### Summary\r\nThis Java application was created in my first year of Computer Science at Cardiff University as part of my fundamentals of computing with Java module. It is a Swing based GUI application that lets you type in the size and position of a rectangle or an Oval and then draw that shape in a new JFrame as well as calculating that chaps area.\r\n\r\n### Compile on Linux/MacOS\r\nOpen up the Sources folder in a terminal window then type;  \r\n\r\n``\r\n$ javac shape.java output.java\r\n``  \r\n\r\nThen check the classes have been generated  \r\n\r\n``\r\n$ ls\r\nshape.java output.java shape.class output.class\r\n``\r\n\r\n### Run on Linux/MacOS\r\nI have already Create class files for those that do not want to edit the code and just want to run the application. Navigate to the Classes folder in a terminal window and simply type.  \r\n\r\n``\r\n$ java shape\r\n``  \r\n\r\nThe program window should now pop up on your screen!.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n1. Enter your desired height, width and x/y co-ordinates in the text boxes, then click on the shape you want to generate (rectangle or oval) [as shown here](http://imgur.com/StOferA,jrZUiFI)\r\n2. A new JFrame window will pop up showing a shape with the dimensions and co-ordinates you specified in the previous window. The previous window will also now display the value of the area f the shape you just drew!\r\n[example output](http://imgur.com/StOferA,jrZUiFI#1)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJust me myself and I!.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
