Summary
This Java application was created in my first year of Computer Science at Cardiff University as part of my fundamentals of computing with Java module. It is a Swing based GUI application that lets you type in the size and position of a rectangle or an Oval and then draw that shape in a new JFrame as well as calculating that chaps area.

Compile on Linux/MacOS
Open up the Sources folder in a terminal window then type;

$ javac shape.java output.java

Then check the classes have been generated

$ ls shape.java output.java shape.class output.class

Run on Linux/MacOS
I have already created class files for those that do not want to edit the code and just want to run the application. Navigate to the Classes folder in a terminal window and simply type.

$ java shape

The program window should now pop up on your screen!.

How to use
Enter your desired height, width and x/y co-ordinates in the text boxes, then click on the shape you want to generate (rectangle or oval) as shown here
A new JFrame window will pop up showing a shape with the dimensions and co-ordinates you specified in the previous window. The previous window will also now display the value of the area f the shape you just drew! example output
